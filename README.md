# Simple_Machine_Learning_Webapp_For_Engineering_Calculation
Hi, I have built a simple machine learning web app by using Pycharm (Python), flask, HTML and CSS. It predicts the power output of a combined cycle power plant by using ambient conditions of temperature, pressure, exhaust vacuum and relative humidity. The data was obtained from UCI online repository. It's link is also given below. Also, the project code link for GitHub is also given below.
